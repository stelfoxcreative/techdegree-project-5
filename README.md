# Project 5 - Build a Web Style Guide

## Project overview
In this project you use SASS to create a Web Style Guide.

This was a fun and challening project and really learned a lot about SASS, I will definitely look to use it in future projects from now on. I have installed CodeKit to the iMac as well which works great with SASS as well as the SASS ruby gem.
